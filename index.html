        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>In many underprivileged school systems, music programs are either non-existent or severely lacking in resources and support. This lack of access to music education has significant implications for students' academic performance, emotional well-being, and overall development.</p>
        <p>According to a study conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), only 15% of students in low-income schools participate in music programs. This disparity is particularly evident in schools with limited resources and high poverty rates.</p>
